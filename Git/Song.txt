My head is haunting me and my heart feels like a ghost
I need to feel something,
Cause I'm still so far from home
Cross your heart and hope to die
Promise me you'll never leave my side

Show me what I can't see
When the spark in my eyes is gone
You got me on my knees, I'm your one man cult
Cross my heart and hope to die
Promise you I'll never leave your side

Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I promise you you're all I see
Cause I'm telling you, you're all I need
I'll never leave

So you can drag me through Hell
If it meant I could hold your hand
I will follow you cause I'm under your spell
And you can throw me to the flames
I will follow you,
I will follow you
